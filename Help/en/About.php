		InfoCentral was developed by a team of volunteers, in their spare time, for the purpose of providing
		churches and other non-profit organizations with high-quality free software.  It is our dream that
		one day, churches and NPO's won't have to spend a dime on software.  Coupled with free operating systems
		like <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> and free office software like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>,
		this dream is quickly becoming a reality.  InfoCentral is a relatively young Open Source project and will undergo much
		change in the future, but we estimate it is already being used by over 100 organizations worldwide in various
		capacities.  If you'd like to find out more or want to help out, please visit our web
		<a href="http://www.infocentral.org">homepage.</a>

		The current InfoCentral project leader is Chris Gebhardt.  His homepage is <a href="http://www.openserve.org">OpenServe.org</a>
