		ChurchInfo is based on InfoCentral, bringing this high-quality free software to organizations which need features not 
      found in the original version.  Infocentral was developed by a team of volunteers, in their spare time, for the purpose of providing
		churches and other non-profit organizations with high-quality free software.  It is our dream that
		one day, churches and NPO's won't have to spend a dime on software.  Coupled with free operating systems
		like <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> and free office software like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>,
		this dream is quickly becoming a reality.  ChurchInfo is distinguished from InfoCentral by the feature set, and the intention
      to continue on a stable, evolutionary path indefinitely.  If you'd like to find out more or want to help out, please visit our web
		<a href="http://www.churchdb.org">homepage.</a>
		<BR><BR>
		The current ChurchInfo project leader is Michael Wilt.
