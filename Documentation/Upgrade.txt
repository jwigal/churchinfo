To upgrade an existing ChurchInfo installation:

Check in the SQL folder for Update...sql files.  These files make changes
to your database so you can run a newer version of ChurchInfo.

Upgrading to 1.2.3:

Save copies of your existing Include/Config.php and Include/ReportConfig.php
for reference.  Most of the configuration options that were previously set
in these files have been moved into the database.  You can now set these 
options by selecting Admin->Edit General Settings and 
Admin->Edit Report Settings.

********** Important Note ***********

As of 1.2.3, the root path to ChurchInfo is specified in the table config_cfg.
The fourth entry in this table should have cfg_name set to "sRootPath" and 
cfg_value set to "/churchinfo".  If want to change this path, you must either
edit Install.sql prior to executing it, or use phpMyAdmin or a similar program
to set this value correcly.  ChurchInfo will not run if this value is not in
agreement with the actual path to ChurchInfo on your server.
