// Some webhosts implement shared SSL differently.  ChurchInfo currently
// works with the following implementation of shared SSL hosting.
//
// Let's say your "normal" http access looks like this:
// http://www.mydomain.org/churchinfo/Default.php
//
// Now let's say that access via your webhosts shared SSL certificate looks like this:
// https://ssl.secureaccess.net/ssl.mydomain.org/churchinfo/Default.php
//
// Here are the settings to implement the above example
// $sSharedSSLServer='ssl.secureaccess.net';
// $sHTTP_Host='ssl.mydomain.org';
//
// If your webhost implements shared SSL differently you may need to modify the
// source code to work with another implementation of shared SSL.  The only
// code that should need to be modified is the function RedirectURL() in
// the file Include/Functions.php.   
// Please post to the sourceforge help forum.  Tell us about your changes to
// get ChurchInfo to work with another implementation of shared SSL and we'll 
// try to add it to the next release.

// SETTINGS END HERE.  DO NOT MODIFY BELOW THIS LINE
